Drum Kit Website
This is a simple drum kit website that allows users to play drums using their keyboard. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Use
To use the drum kit, simply press the corresponding keys on your keyboard. The keys are mapped to different drum sounds, and you can play them in any order to create your own beats.

DOM Manipulation
The website uses JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the webpage. When a user presses a key on their keyboard, the corresponding drum sound is played and an animation is triggered on the button element. This is achieved by adding and removing CSS classes using JavaScript.

Here are some of the key JavaScript functions used for DOM manipulation:

document.querySelector(): This function is used to select an element from the DOM based on its CSS selector.
element.classList.add(): This function is used to add a CSS class to an element.
element.classList.remove(): This function is used to remove a CSS class from an element.
element.addEventListener(): This function is used to add an event listener to an element.
